Curious about what Iranian tea might be like, I went there and had a cup. It had a different taste than I expected, and I really liked it. After reaching 3 kilometers away, I remembered the taste of that tea and decided to go back. I had another two cups. Great!`,

The place has a cool seating area, and it's usually packed during mornings and evenings. Worth visiting if you're curious about Irani tea!",
